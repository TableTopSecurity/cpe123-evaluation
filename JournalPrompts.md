# Journal Prompts
Weekly reflective journal prompts and the construct they intend to measure.


## Week 1
In the last week, how would you characterize the nature of the interactions between group members? Please comment on the modes of communication (e.g., email, text, group wiki), frequency, level of detail, and quality of the interactions, as well as your perceptions as to the equity of the interactions (e.g., were all opinions treated equally?).

 * Primary: Engagement and participation in course material
 * Secondary: Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation


## Week 2
What connections, if any, have you made between the concepts taught in class and your behaviors outside of class? These might include conversations with others, changes in your own computing habits, or extracurricular investigations into the subject matter.

 * Primary: Student understanding of computing security principles
 * Secondary: Impact on security behaviors


## Week 3
As part of your lab last week, you were asked to attack the professor through deception and social engineering. Please describe how engaging in this kind of adversarial thinking made you feel?

 * Primary: Attitudes and perceptions toward security
 * Secondary: Confidence


## Week 4
Describe how your level of experience in writing code has impacted your participation in the class, and in particular the computer security content.

 * Primary: Confidence and engagement in course materials
 * Secondary: How games affect skills development and communication of content


## Week 5
Describe how the role of intrigue in computer security has affected your participation, interest, and motivation in lecture and lab.

 * Primary: Attitudes and perceptions toward security
 * Secondary: How games affect student engagement


## Week 6
In lab, you have been asked to participate in groups to solve computer security-themed challenges. Reflect upon your interactions in the group. Did you fall into any consistent roles that would characterize the way in which you typically contributed to the success of the group? If so, how would you label this role? How would you label the roles that other group members appeared to adopt? 

 * Primary: Student perception of success and capabilities in security
 * Secondary: How games induce roles, and how to help identify the value of an individual to a larger organization


## Week 7
For homework, you were asked to pick a topic or concept from class and share it a roommate, friend, or family member. What influenced you to pick your topic? What was your learning objective for this assignment and why did you choose it? What form did your presentation take? Who were your students? Reflect on the degree to which you felt your learning objective was met.

 * Primary: Engagement with course materials, Confidence; 
 * Secondary: Understanding of fundamental computer security principles, utility of computer security, secure computing behaviors
